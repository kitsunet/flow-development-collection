~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`BUGFIX: Type Handling should not break when classnames contain underscores, or when classnames are lowerCamelCase <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/441>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While underscores in class names are not used in Flow code itself, it might
happen that TypeHandling is used outside Flow - where having underscores
in class names is perfectly valid.

This change ensures that underscores in class names are recognized properly.

`TASK: Adjust unit tests to use "real mocks" <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/429>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mocking a "virtual" class is no longer allowed, so we use fixture classes.

`BUGFIX: Require latest version of neos/composer-plugin <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/414>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Require version 2.x of the ``composer-plugin`` package. Previous versions
use the ``excludeClasses`` setting which has been deprecated with Flow 3.0.

`BUGFIX: Fix Property Mapper determination for the ObjectConverter <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/397>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When mapping a plain object with the ``ObjectConverter``, root namespace 
properties like ``\\DateTime`` do not find a converter. This is because
the leading backslash is not removed by the ``ObjectConverter`` (i.e. we
looked for a ``\\DateTimeConverter`` instead of the ``DateTimeConverter``

`BUGFIX: Input field name for multiple checkbox is generated correctly <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/386>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Checkboxes that were bound to collection properties or had the `multiple` attribute set,
were generating invalid input field names like this:

    <input type="checkbox" name="post[tags][__identity][]" ...>

Since the internal identity is not required for checkboxes, it is stripped from the generated name.
Also, any such checkboxes now avoid generating an empty value hidden field, as this will at most
lead to empty values being additionally submitted to the collection property.

`BUGFIX: Use Unix paths in InstallerScripts <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/400>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Files utility used by InstallerScripts will use these constants
to transform an absolute path to a relative one. As the compared path
will always be a Unix path, the path to replace needs to be completely
Unix as well to make replacing working. This prevents "mkdir(): invalid
arguments" errors on Windows.

Similar to neos/flow-development-collection#399 , but then for the 3.0
version.

`BUGFIX: Allow SliceOperation to work on \\Iterator <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/398>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Eel slice operation only works with arrays so far. Since the FlowQuery
context can be anything that implements `\\Iterator`, we now convert iterators
to arrays if they are passed in as the context.

* Packages: ``Eel`` ``Flow``

`BUGFIX: Check if array is \`\`null\`\` at the beginning of JSON conversion <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/395>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prevent an exception to be thrown if the array passed for conversion is ``null``.

`TASK: Fix documentation about Privilege Parameters <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/392>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixes the `Policy.yaml` examples in the Privilege Parameters section of the Security chapter.

FLOW-459 #close

`BUGFIX: FlowException is no imported <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/391>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This change fixes a missing class import introduced with PR #376 into the 2.3 branch.

`BUGIX: Remove temporary file in importTemporaryFile() <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/389>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The temporary file used to be gone after importing, but since it only is
moved when the target does not yet exist, this changed. Now the file is
unlinked in that case.
